# Chess in Ruby

This is a fully functional implementation of Chess for the command line using OOP principles. Bonus features include:

* Arrow key controls (no need to type in coordinates!)
* Computer "AI" that only plays valid moves
* Visualization of possible moves when a piece is selected
* Play with two humans, two AIs, or one of each!

Possible future features:

* Visualization of squares that are under attack (could be taken on the next turn)
* Better AI - probably heuristic/tree-based
* Move history/playback/saving

## Usage

Download the .zip, and double click `chess.sh` (on a mac). Alternatively, run `ruby chess.rb` in the command line.
Currently you change the players by editing `chess.rb`. This will likely be replaced with a proper menu.
